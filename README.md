This repository contains a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.  A common error when calculating averages is the potential for a `ZeroDivisionError` if the input list is empty. This example demonstrates how to gracefully handle this case by returning 0 when the list is empty, thus preventing the error.  The solution file demonstrates the corrected implementation.
